        <p>I am currently working as a software developer for SGWorld Ltd. I work as part of a small team who are focused on moving some of our older products into the current era, using cloud based solutions with a variety of different technologies.</p>
        <p>Whilst here I have mostly been working with .NET Core, developing MVC applications, and a number of different Javascript frameworks for client-side applications, Angular, Electron and Nativescript to name a few. I have also been able to gain experience with a number of database engines including MongoDB, MicrosoftSQL, and PostgreSQL. I was also largely involved in our move to Azure and setup most of our devops pipelines for building, testing and deploying our application.</p>
        <p>In my spare time,I tend to lean towards using NodeJS (usually with Typescript) or Python, both of which I enjoy for their simplicity, endless amounts of documentation, support and ease of use. Both of these languages have their quirks, bt that usually adds to the fun.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Coventry University in Q3 of 2017 with a first class degree in Ethical Hacking and Network Security, besides the odd few months of work here and there this has been my first full time job. I am extremely thankful for the experience I have been able to pick up whilst at SGWorld.</p>
