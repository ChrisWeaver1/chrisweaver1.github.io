        <p>
            I am currently working as a software developer for SGWorld Ltd. I work as part of a small team who are focused on moving some of 
            our older products into the current era, using cloud based solutions with a variety of different technologies such as .NET Core, 
            Angular7, Microsoft SQL among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating from Coventry University in Q3 of 2017 with a first class degree in Ethical Hacking, this has been my first full time job. 
            I am extremely thankful for the experience I have been able to pick up whilst at SG World.
        </p>
        <p>
           In my spare time, I tend to lean towards using NodeJS (usually with Typescript) or Python, both of which I enjoy for their simplicity, 
           endless amounts of documentation, support and ease of use. Both of these languages have their quirks, but that usually adds to the fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I have gained some experience in the field, it is a goal of mine to start contributing to more open-source projects. I really enjoy the collaboration, 
            purpose and culture surrounding open-source development and I realise that they are the basis for many of the tools, technologies and even commercial 
            products we use in our day-to-day lives.

                Currently, I am working as part of a small team to bring older products into the present era by developing cloud based applications. 
                Our stack mainly consists of .NET Core, Angular and Microsoft SQL, however we certainly haven't been afraid to branch out from this 
                using other technologies like MongoDB, Electron, Nativescript, Java and Python. We also use many different tools to assist us like Git and Github, Jira, Azure DevOps and Docker.
                <br><br>
                This has been my first 'real job' after university, where I started working as a Junior Developer, after gaining some experience 
                I have been provided with many opportunities to take the lead on a number of projects including our partial move to MongoDB, the initial 
                draft of our visitor management solution, an Electron based touch screen application and Azure DevOps for builds, testing and releases.

            <small>
                Although this was only ~3 months of work experience, I gained a good amount of experience working alongside a group of experienced engineers. 
                I was assisting in building technologies used in the factories for keeping track of print toner cartridges that can later be reused or 
                recycled as part of Ricoh's <a href="https://www.ricoh-europe.com/business-services/all-services/sustainability-management-services/sustainability-portfolio.html">resource conservation</a> effort.

            <small>
                During the summer of my 2nd year of university I was provided with the opportunity of joining some of my tutors as a research assistant. 
                I was set the task of creating a tool to help them test new <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-definition/">SDN technologies</a> and their effect on the network. 
                To do this I used Python, Mininet and IPerf and built an application that allowed them to build scalable networks of different topologies and test 
                latency and throughput with adjustable bandwidth. I later built up on this application in my dissertation where I explored how SDN could be used to help 
                mitigate DDOS attacks on different networks.
