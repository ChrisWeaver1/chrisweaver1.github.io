### About Me

I currently work as part of a small team at SG World Ltd, we are focused on moving some of our older products into the current era by producing cloud based solutions using a variety of different technologies including .NET Core, Angular, Electron, Microsoft SQL and MongoDB. 

Alongside what I do at work, I have a decent amount of experience using other languages like Python, Golang and JS/Node/Typescript and their respective ecosystems. I am also proficient with a number of development tools, git, Github, CI/CD (Azure devops, Travis and Github Actions), Docker, Azure and VS Code (the superior IDE). 

I graduated from Coventry University with a first class degree in Ethical Hacking in late 2017. Here I was able able to gain alot of experience in computing, many tools and techniques and also a lot of experience playing around with Python and Linux based operating systems.

### Work Experience

###### Software Developer, SG World Ltd 
`March 2018 - Present`

Currently, I am working as part of a small team to bring older products into the present era by developing cloud based applications. Our stack mainly consists of .NET Core, Angular and Microsoft SQL, however we certainly haven't been afraid to branch out from this, using other technologies like MongoDB, Electron, Nativescript, Java and Python. We also use many different tools to assist us like Git, Github, Jira, Azure DevOps and Docker.

This has been my first 'real job' since graduating from university, where I started working as a Junior Developer. After gaining some experience, I have been provided with many opportunities to take the lead on a number of projects including our partial move to MongoDB, the initial draft of our visitor management solution, an Electron based touchscreen application and Azure for Devops CI/CD and cloud hosting.

###### Software Engineer (Work experience), Ricoh Telford 
`September 2017 - November 2017`

Although this was only ~3 months of work, I gained a good amount of experience working alongside a group of engineers. I was assisting in building technologies used in the factories for keeping track of print toner cartridges that can later be reused or recycled as part of Ricoh's resource conservation effort.


###### Research Assistant (Internship), Coventry University 
`May 2016 - August 2016`

During the summer of my 2nd year of university I was provided with the opportunity of joining some of my tutors as a research assistant. I was set the task of creating a tool to help them test new SDN technologies and their effect on the network. To do this I used Python, Mininet and IPerf and built an application that allowed them to build scalable networks of different topologies and test latency and throughput with adjustable bandwidth. I later built up on this application in my dissertation where I explored how SDN could be used to help mitigate DDOS attacks on different networks.
