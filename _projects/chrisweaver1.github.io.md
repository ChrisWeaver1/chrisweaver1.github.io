My portfolio/personal website and blog built using Jekyll and hosted by Github Pages. I've gone through quite afew iterations of personal websites starting from when I originally made one in university. This is certainly the one I am most pleased with. I tend struggle with the design aspect of making websites, I can be quite picky and I have ideas about what I want to create, but actually applying that onto a webpage has proven a challenge. But fortunately with a combination of Bootstrap4, Jekyll and some other things I have made it work this time and produced a somewhat nice portfolio, for me atleast, it certainly doesn't rival others I have seen.
